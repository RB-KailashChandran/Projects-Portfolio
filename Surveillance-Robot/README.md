Summary-
The project presents a multifunctional surveillance robot designed for autonomous mobility and real-time monitoring across indoor and outdoor terrains. 
Built using ESP32, servo systems, and an IP camera, the robot supports multi-axis movement, stair climbing, and wireless remote control. 
Its radially distributed leg architecture enables adaptive motion, stability, and repositioning for complex environments. 
The prototype serves as a foundational platform for future enhancement with additional sensors and advanced autonomous behaviors.
